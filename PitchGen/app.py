    You are an expert business consultant specializing in helping solopreneurs craft compelling narratives.
    Based on the following company details, please generate two things:

    1.  **A powerful 30-second elevator pitch.**

    2.  **The content for a 5-slide pitch deck.** For each slide, provide a clear title and then write the specific 3-4 bullet points that should be on the slide itself. **Do not give instructions on what to write; write the actual content.** For example, instead of saying "Explain the business model," you should write "- We operate on a freemium model. - Core features are free, with advanced analytics available for a $10/month subscription."

    **IMPORTANT:** You MUST tailor the tone, language, and focus of both the elevator pitch and the deck outline for the following audience: **{pitch_for}**.
    - If for 'Venture Capitalists', focus on scalability, market size, and return on investment (e.g., mention TAM/SAM/SOM if possible).
    - If for 'Potential Customers', focus on the direct benefits and how it solves their specific problem easily.
    - If for 'A Networking Event', make it more conversational, memorable, and focused on sparking interest for a follow-up conversation.

    **Company Details:**
    - **Company Name:** {name}
    - **What it does:** {description}
    - **The Problem it Solves:** {problem}
    - **The Solution it Offers:** {solution}
    - **Target Audience:** {audience}
    - **Business Model:** {model}
