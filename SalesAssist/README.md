# Claude Startup Insights Bot

This project is an AI-powered sales tool built with Streamlit and Anthropic's Claude API. It helps sales teams analyze startup data to identify high-potential leads, understand their needs, and generate tailored outreach strategies.

## How It Works

The application functions as a data enrichment and analysis pipeline. It takes a list of startups (either from sample data or a user-uploaded file), sends each startup's information to the Claude API for analysis, and then displays the enriched data in an interactive dashboard. The user can then chat with an AI assistant to ask further questions about the analyzed data.

### Core Workflow

1.  **Initialization**: When the app starts (`streamlit run app.py`), it first validates the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the `.env` file.
2.  **Initial Data Processing**: On the first load, the app takes the sample data from `sample_data.py`, sends it to the `ClaudeAnalyzer` for scoring and justification, and stores the results.
3.  **Display**: The processed data is displayed in a visual dashboard with metrics, charts, and a detailed table.
4.  **User Upload**: A user can upload their own CSV or Excel file. The app parses this file, standardizes column names, and sends the data through the same Claude analysis pipeline.
5.  **Interactive Chat**: The user can ask natural language questions about the data, which are answered by Claude using the context of the analyzed startups.

## File Breakdown

Here is a description of the key files and directories in the project:

| File / Directory      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app.py`              | **Main Application File**. This is the entry point for the Streamlit app. It defines the entire user interface (UI), handles data loading and uploading, orchestrates the analysis process, and displays all tables and charts. |
| `claude_analyzer.py`  | **The AI Engine**. This file contains the `ClaudeAnalyzer` class, which manages all communication with the Claude API. It includes methods for calculating fit scores, enriching data, and handling API errors and retries. |
| `sample_data.py`      | **Sample Dataset**. Provides a default list of startups so the application can be used immediately without requiring a file upload.                                                                    |
| `test_error_handling.py` | **Testing Script**. A utility script used during development to verify that the error handling and logging in `claude_analyzer.py` and `app.py` work as expected.                                    |
| `requirements.txt`    | **Dependencies**. Lists all the Python libraries needed to run the project. You install these using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.                                                                    |
| `.env`                | **Environment Variables**. A local, private file (not committed to version control) where the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is securely stored.                                                                   |
| `README.md`           | **Project Documentation**. This file, which you are currently reading.                                                                                                                                      |

## How to Set Up and Run

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   An API key from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Your API Key

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add your Anthropic API key to it:
